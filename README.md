# LM2Decomp
An attempt at decompiling Luigi's Mansion 2 (Dark Moon)

This is meant to be a rough decompilation with the goal of making the internal workings of the
engine more understandable.

The game uses a custom engine that Next Level Games uses for basically all its games. However
alot has changed from game to game.
